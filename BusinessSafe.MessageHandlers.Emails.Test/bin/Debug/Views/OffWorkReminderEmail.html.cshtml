    <p>
        When the entry was made they had not returned to work and the number of days that they
        were unable to work was not completed. This information is required to determine whether the injury
        is reportable to the enforcing authorities.

            Please use the link below to take you to BusinessSafe Online where you
            can add this information. If the person has still not returned to work or is unable to do their
            normal work select ‘8 or more days’ which means the accident is reportable to the local
            enforcing authority. To find out how to report, please visit ‘Next Steps’ section of the accident
