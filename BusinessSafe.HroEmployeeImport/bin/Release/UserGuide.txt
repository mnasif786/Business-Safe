Usage
=====

1 - Unzip application to folder.

2 - Create "C:\EmployeeImportFiles"
		or
	(if required)
	Create Import folder elsewhere
	Edit configuration so that "EmployeeImportFileDirectory" refers to the import folder
	(See Configuration section below)

3 - (if required)
	Update Database connection strings in config

4 - Copy customer CSV file to Import folder (by default, "C:\EmployeeImportFiles")

5 - Run "BusinessSafe.HroEmployeeImport.exe" from command line

6 - At the prompt, select the database server - D(evelopment), U(AT) or L(ive). Pressing return without a selection uses the default (LIVE) database. Using a local DEV database initially 
	allows any errors in the CSV file to be found and fixed before they reach the live database

7 - At the prompt, enter the Client Account Number (CAN) for the customer whose data is being imported.

8 - The application will attempt to read the CSV file and add the employee data to the [BusinessSafe].[dbo].[Employee] database on the selected server.

9 - Any errors will be displayed on screen and the processing stopped. (See below)

10 - When the processing is complete without error, the CSV file will be moved to the DONE folder


Errors
======

When attempting to import an employee, if an existing employee is found who has the same ClientID, Forename and Surname, then the new employee record will not be imported.
A warning will be displayed (e.g. "FRED FLINTSTONE already exists for client ABC123 and cannot be imported." )and processing will continue on the rest of the file.

If an employee record does not contain either a Forename or Surname, an error will be raised and processing on the file will stop. 

Employee Data
=============

The customer will provide employee data in a CSV file, or in an EXCEL file which must be saved as CSV. 

The customer has been provided with a template EXCEL file so the data should be in a recognised format.

The CSV file will consist of a Header row and a series of employee records. The following Header field will be used when creating the BSO employee records

				BSO field				Customer field
				=========				==============
				Forename				"Forename"
				Surname					"Surname"

Configuration
=============

The main exe is "BusinessSafe.HroEmployeeImport.exe" which uses the following configuration, found in the "BusinessSafe.HroEmployeeImport.exe.config" file:-

 <appSettings>
    <add key="EmployeeImportFileDirectory" value="C:\EmployeeImportFiles" />    
  </appSettings>

  EmployeeImportFileDirectory is the pathname of the folder where the application expects to find the Customer CSV file which is to be imported.
  The application will create a subfolder within this called "Done". When the CSV file has been processed, it will be moved to the "Done" folder

<connectionStrings>
	<add name="DevDB" connectionString="Data Source='localhost\SQL2008R2';Initial Catalog=BusinessSafe;Min Pool Size=2;Max Pool Size=60;Connect Timeout=60;User Id=intranetadmin;Password=intadpas;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	<add name="UATDB" connectionString="Data Source='UATSQL2\UAT';Initial Catalog=BusinessSafe;Min Pool Size=2;Max Pool Size=60;Connect Timeout=60;User Id=intranetadmin;Password=intadpas;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	<add name="LiveDB" connectionString="Data Source='PBSPROD2SQL\PROD2';Initial Catalog=BusinessSafe;Min Pool Size=2;Max Pool Size=60;Connect Timeout=60;User Id=intranetadmin;Password=intadpas;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
<connectionStrings>

The application allows you to import to one of three databases, Development, UAT or Live. The 3 connection strings above specify their connections.
