	In order to avoid silly mistakes
	As a math idiot
	I want to be told the sum of two numbers

#Scenario: Records can be order by heading
#	Given I have logged in as company with id '55881'
#	And I am on the accident record index page	
#	And I wait for '1000' miliseconds
#   When I press 'title' button
#	Then The following record should exist in the accident record table::
#	| Ref    | Title                 | Description                       | Injured Person      | Severity     | Site                  | Reported By      | Date Of Accident | Date Created |
#	| REF001 | Assassinated by Alan  | One                               | Main Site            | Compliance    | Russell Williams     | Outstanding      | 22/07/2013       | 10/06/2050   |
